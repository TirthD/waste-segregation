# waste-segregation
The management of waste is a critical issue in today's world, as it has a significant impact on the environment. In this context, a waste segregating machine that can efficiently segregate dry and wet waste can prove to be an innovative solution. This project aims to develop a waste segregating machine that utilizes Arduino, Aluminium foil as a moisture sensor, and IR sensor to detect waste.

The proposed prototype employs an Arduino micro-controller that receives input from the Aluminium foil regarding the moisture content of the waste in the form of capacitance and IR sensor to detect waste. The waste is segregated into two separate sections, dry and wet, to facilitate the recycling process.

The system is designed to be low-cost, compact, and user-friendly. The use of Arduino ensures that the prototype can be easily programmed and updated. The Aluminium foil sensor, used to detect the moisture content of the waste, can be circumscribed in terms of the moisture level. The machine can handle a wide range of waste types, making it versatile and suitable for use in a variety of settings.

In summary, This prototype can help manage waste more effectively, reduce the environmental impact, and facilitate the recycling process.
